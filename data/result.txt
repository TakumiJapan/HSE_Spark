Tokyo says goodbye to the Games with grace and sense of relief.

Japan’s Olympics has been troubled but quietly glorious, reminding us the world can be fun.

Farewell then, Tokyo 2020. On a sweltering night at the Olympic Stadium, Japan said goodbye to its troubled, quietly glorious Games with a closing ceremony that was by turns elegant, sombre and hilariously unbound. Not to mention, in the grand Olympic tradition, crammed full of schmaltz and corporate doublespeak.
At 10pm local time the IOC president, Thomas Bach, emerged on to his lighted plinth to declare Tokyo 2020 closed – and to offer up something else too, to lobby for its place in history. 

“Dear athletes, over the last 16 days you have amazed us,” Bach told his worldwide TV audience, coming on like an irresistible corporate rain-maker in turquoise tie, light blue suit and crisp white mask, and surrounded with the traditional hand of handsome young people draped in medals.

“You created the magic of these Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020. You were stronger because we all stood together in solidarity.” There is a weary Olympic bingo to these platitudes, these join-the-dots uplifting statements. But for all the usual peace stuff, the unity stuff, there was an added urgency here as Bach used his closing notes to apply the IOC gloss to the way these Games in the time of plague will be remembered.

Tokyo has been a warm, courteous and resourceful host, but also a troubled one. Outside the stadium there were protests in the streets and cries of “No Olympics” as the delegates, wonks and team members left the show at the end. The display of disaffection was orderly but assertive, marking the anger many people have felt at the staging of this global event in a city where the line between contagion and control is already stretched thin.

“You were competing fiercely with each other in pursuit of Olympic gold,” Bach went on. “At the same time you were living together in peace. This is a powerful message of solidarity and peace. For the first time since the pandemic began the entire world came together. Sport returned to centre stage … This gives us hope. This give us faith in the future.” Does it though? As ever these occasions tend to pose other questions.

Questions like, what is the Olympics actually for? Why, exactly, are we doing this? The Olympic Games still likes to style itself as “a movement”, an arm of international relations, a force for fellowship and joy, as opposed to, say, a heavily branded corporate circus. The insistence on these transcendent qualities springs from the burden the Games place on those sleeted to host and fund it. That empty host stadium cost $1.3bn (£0.9bn). There must also be magic dust.

This kind of talk might carry more weight with critics of the Olympic-industrial complex were it not for the fact this celebration of love, so recently in Azerbaijan and Russia, heads next to China for the winter Games. But never mind that for now. Just look at the lights.

“The Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020 are the Olympic Games of hope, unity and peace,” Bach concluded, having maintained, disingenuously, that the reason for staging Tokyo 2020 at such a dangerous time was to fulfil the wishes of the athletes, as opposed to commercial contracts carrying ruinous losses.

And yet, as every Big Sport executive knows, something in that human spectacle will always keep us coming back for more. Bach had emerged into the Olympic arena two hours earlier as inspirational music swelled and a thrilling blue sheen spread across the tiers of this reconditioned ghost-stadium. The staging was lavish, kitsch and lavishly kitsch, the central area fitted out with an arrangement of plinths and podiums, plus at one end the Olympic flame itself, leaping up out of a kind of squashed dinosaur egg affair.

For much of the two hours that followed this was an elegantly stripped back ceremony, commemorative rather than celebratory. At the start the Japanese flag was carried into the arena very slowly, with a moving sense of formal calm.

The flags of the competing nations followed, Great Britain’s held by Laura Kenny, now the most decorated female British Olympian ever. And steadily the night dissolved into kind of world music mashup, from rhumba to nose flute twirls to jazz funk bass, as the athletes came bouncing into the stadium, clapped on heartily by a row of stewards who, besides dancing like your aunt at Christmas, seemed to be having a genuinely great time.

For a while the stadium resembled a human Fantasia, a whirl of colour and marching music – barks and bings, bagpipes, klaxons, strange gurgling noises. The volunteers passed through, waving at the crowd and drawing their own ovation. It is hard to do justice to the Tokyo 2020 volunteer army, who have been warm and stoical and endlessly patient with this mess of uncooperative humanity, and all this at a Games many Tokyoites didn’t want.

The nations came and went. Team Russia (Not Russia) waved for the camera.

The oddity of Russia’s presence here in such numbers despite an apparent doping ban – another dismal IOC saga, a tarnishing of the sports it is charged with preserving – was never the fault of the athletes. This was just a bunch of very happy young people having the time of their lives.

And by now the central carpet was crammed with all the flags of the world, glowing examples of physical splendour, of species power. OK, people of the cosmos. We’re ready for our close up now. That lot over there under the lights. That’s what we’re like. At its best Tokyo 2020 has been like this, not just spectacular but also soothing, a reminder that the world can also be a fun place.

As the flame was handed over by video link to Paris 2024, skyline captured in a stunningly beautiful film, it was hard again to avoid that duality.

For all the talk of a new “sustainable” Olympics, the world’s largest industrial sporting event will continue to toy with overspending, waste and dubious regimes. Men will appear on plinths talking about peace and love while the stadium noise drowns out the shouts beyond its walls.

And Tokyo will now breathe again, at the end of 14 days of spectator-free, fiercely marshalled competition, from rhythmic gymnastics to the two-person dinghy, from the fastest humans on Earth to the 87kg clean and jerk. This brilliantly seductive mess of a global sporting beano has now finally said goodbye – with grace and verve, but with a sense, also, of relief.

The Tokyo Olympics, postponed and played out behind closed doors because of the Covid pandemic, concluded with an upbeat ceremony in Japan's capital.

The Games took place without spectators and athletes were barred from venturing outside the Olympic village.

Their staging has faced local opposition and around 30 protestors jostled with police at the National Stadium before the closing ceremony.

However, other locals have braved heat and warnings to watch events from afar.

Fans took in outdoor events, such as triathlon and BMX, from overpasses and other vantage points despite temperatures that reached 35C, the hottest ever recorded at an Olympics.

The Games' official sign-off, featuring ska bands, football freestylers, breakdancers and BMX riders, created more made-for-TV memories, culminating in athletes thanking the people of Japan by making a heart gesture with their hands.

A scaled-down parade of flagbearers, missing 62 of the competing nations, started proceedings in Tokyo before an air display team painted the French tricolore across the sky in Paris, the host city for 2024.

Tokyo 2020 president Seiko Hashimoto, who appeared at seven Games as a speed skater and then a track cyclist, told the athletes: "There are no words to describe what you have achieved.

"You have accepted what seemed unimaginable, understood what had to be done, and through hard work and perseverance overcome unbelievable challenges."

She added: "This has made you true Olympians."

Athletes had daily swabs to test for coronavirus and wore face masks when not eating, training or competing. After they had finished competing, they had 48 hours to leave the athletes' village.

Games produce stars and the unexpected

The Games were postponed a year from their original 2020 date and, as the global pandemic raged, Japanese support wavered, with unfavourable opinion polls in the months before and even the country's Emperor Naruhito expressing concerns about their staging.

The banning of spectators from most venues denied the Japanese public a chance to watch a summer Games close up for the first time since Tokyo 1964 and the climax of an eight-year wait after winning the hosting rights in Buenos Aires in 2013.

As ever, the Games produced a shower of stars. American swimmer Caeleb Dressel won five golds in the pool. Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah won another three on the track. Gymnast Daiki Hashimoto won two for the home nation in gymnastics.

But, equally inevitably, there were moments that no-one could have expected.

Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi and Qatar's Mutaz Barshim deciding to share high-jump gold rather than contest the title.

Norwegian Lotte Miller consoling Belgian rival Claire Michel after she came in last in the triathlon.

Simone Biles, predicted to collect a clutch of golds, instead highlighting athletes' mental health as she protected herself by withdrawing from five of her six events.

The next Olympics begin in just 180 days time with the Winter Games opening in Beijing on 4 February. The next Summer Olympics are just three years away, with Paris hosting in 2024, before Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032.

Britain match London tally and set sights high for Paris 2024
Despite a build-up blighted by lockdowns, Great Britain surpassed the 51 medals won in Beijing 2008, matched the 65 won in London 2012 and ended just two short of their Rio 2016 total.

Track cyclist Jason Kenny became the first Briton to win seven gold medals as he retained his keirin title, while Laura Kenny became the most successful female cyclist in history as she took her tally of golds to five with madison success alongside Katie Archibald.

There were new stars as well. Twenty-one-year-old Tom Dean won a pair of golds in the pool, Bethany Shriever and Charlotte Worthington took BMX titles, and Keely Hodgkinson, 19, won a superb 800m silver on the track. Emily Campbell won Britain's first female weightlifting medal.

Sky Brown became Britain's youngest ever summer Games medallist in one of the Games' newest sports with a skateboarding bronze.

"Not only has the team made history but it has probably made history on the back of the most complex and most challenging and difficult environment that we will face certainly in my lifetime," said Team GB's chef de mission Mark England.

"It has been against all the odds and I think it is the greatest achievement in British Olympic history.

"This is a very, very young team and a very talented team, and a team I'm absolutely confident that will go to Paris in less than three years and do exceptionally well."Fireworks and face masks as Tokyo douses Olympic flame on pandemic-defying Games

Masked athletes marched into a near-empty stadium in Tokyo on Sunday as Japan prepared to douse its Olympic flame and close a Games that were upended by the pandemic and then transformed by the drama of politics, sport and personal turmoil.

A volley of white-and-gold fireworks streaked above the Olympic Stadium, putting in sharp relief the oddity of a Games held without spectators.

The stage looked sparse even as athletes marched in carrying their national flags. Many of the best-known athletes have already left Tokyo and were not able to attend Sunday’s event. Athletes are supposed to fly home 48 hours after their final competition.

The Tokyo Olympics were originally intended to show Japan’s recovery from a devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in 2011. After being postponed for a year, organisers said the Games would serve as a symbol of the world’s triumph over the pandemic. But without spectators and with COVID-19 variants resurgent, the Games fell short of triumph and the financial windfall Japan first sought.

Public anger over the pandemic response and a slow-to-start vaccine roll-out have badly damaged Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s standing. Public opinion polls showed most Japanese opposed holding the Games during the pandemic.

Olympic judo champion Naohisa Takato and swimmer Yui Ohashi were among those who carried the national flag into the stadium at the start.

The Takarazuka Revue, an all-women musical theatre group with a history spanning more than a century, sang the national anthem dressed in colourful traditional hakama.

It seemed an odd pairing for the Games, as the Takarazuka allows only unmarried women to perform and touts “modesty” and “grace” as part of its motto. The Games, by contrast, are said to stress gender equality.

Around a hundred protesters carrying signs that read “Olympics kill the poor” and “We don’t need the Olympics” jostled with police officers outside the stadium, although they were outnumbered by the crowd that lined the streets. Would-be spectators came out in force during the Games, defying authoritiesand blistering heat to peek in from overpasses as they tried to catch a glimpse of outdoor events such as the triathlon or new sports such as skateboarding.

Organisers appear to have prevented the Games from spiralling into a COVID-19 superspreader event, notable given that some 50,000 people came together amid the pandemic.

While the bubble - the set of venues and hotels to which Olympic visitors were largely confined - appeared to hold, elsewhere some things fell apart. Fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus, daily infections spiked to more than 5,000 for the first time in Tokyo, threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.
Holding the Olympics was the right call

In the lead up to the Olympic Games, it was widely reported that most of the Japanese public were against the Olympic games being held in its country. Domestic and international media reporting repeatedly emphasized the possibility that the Olympic Games could be a super-spreader event.

And now that the Games have come and gone, it may seem, on the surface, like the media was right. New daily cases have spiked in Tokyo, rising from 1,128 new infections on July 23, the day the Olympics began, to a peak of 5,042 on August 4, according to official numbers from Tokyo. But, if you look closely at the spread of disease in Japan, a different picture emerges -- one where the Olympic village was largely unaffected by Covid-19 while it spread rapidly elsewhere throughout the city. With over 11,000 people housed in the Olympic village, 511 Covid-19 cases have been reported among those associated with the Games as of Wednesday, according to the official Olympic report. That is an impressively low statistic.

A public opinion poll, conducted between July 23-25 and published in the Nikkei newspaper, shows that Japanese citizens may have correctly anticipated that holding the Olympics with some Covid precautions would allow for the Games to be held safely. Only 31% of those polled prefer to cancel the Games or repostpone, while 37% said that holding the Games with no spectators is an appropriate decision, 25% said there should be some spectators and 3% felt the stadium should be in full capacity.
What might have accounted for this optimism among Japanese citizens? Perhaps they realized that the risk of Covid-19 was in fact within a tolerable range, based on some of the key safety measure that were put in place in the Olympic village.
First, the fact that most ordinary spectators were not allowed to attend the Games seemed to ease the minds of many people. While Japan initially set a cap of 10,000 spectators at the Games, the government changed its mind given the uptick of new cases two weeks before the Opening Ceremony.
Dr. Shigeru Omi, a leading Covid-19 adviser to the Japanese government (who has been called the Dr. Anthony Fauci of Japan), strongly recommended that fans stay home to watch the Games, as opposed to gathering in groups.

Although Japan had already experienced soccer and baseball matches with limited spectators without creating a cluster of cases, the government may have feared that bringing spectators into the Olympic arena would be a sign to the public that they could gather and cheer for their teams in large numbers outside the stadium as well.

It would have been difficult to give a coherent message that it's fine to gather and cheer inside while watching the events in person, but not outside. So, instead, the government committed to the message that everyone should stay home and watch the Games on TV -- and in doing so took a major precautionary measure to protect the public from contagion.
Second, the quickened pace of vaccine administration may have given some Japanese people confidence in the fact that the tides were turning on Japan's lagging Covid-19 inoculation rate. Japan began vaccine administration in February
In early May, the government set a goal of administering 1 million vaccine doses per day, and by the beginning of August, 35.7% of people were fully vaccinated and 12.2% had been partially vaccinated. Importantly, like many other nations, the vaccination campaign started with inoculations for people at high risk, such as those over 65 years old.
According to the Prime Minister's office, 87.8% of the elderly are at least vaccinated with one dose (and 82.3% have gotten a second dose). This uptick provided confidence that even though there would be some spread of disease, there would be less pressure on doctors and nurses to treat the vulnerable populations, and there would likely be fewer Covid-related deaths than were seen in the earlier months of the pandemic. In fact, as of July 28, individuals over 65 make up just 6% of the new cases in Tokyo and surrounding cities, according to Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease. Thus, there may have been a sense of relief that the Olympics may not pose as big a threat to these cities' populations as was initially thought.

Third, there has been a certain confidence in the "bubble" method of containing disease spread. The athletes and officials were tested every day. They were encouraged not to leave the Olympic village and were monitored by contact tracing apps.
Although throughout the Games there were still some who were fiercely opposed to the Olympics being held at this point in the pandemic, the low positivity rate so far has proved the "bubble" worked.Hashimoto : "It's not perfect ..." as Olympics end

Hashimoto Seiko, chairperson of the Organizing Committee for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, held a press conference on August 8 before the closing of the Olympics. Hashimoto commented on the tournament under the expansion of COVID-19 "It was difficult to hold the Olympics while ensuring safety and security. It was not perfect, but I think that it was acclaimed as a whole." .
When asked about the public's understanding of the event, Hashimoto said, "I feel that it is not 100% accepted." Regarding the evaluation of success, she said, "I would like to answer after the Paralympics. There were some issues and points for improvement, I have to make use of them in the future."
There are 19 players who were abstained due to the infection with COVID-19. Hashimoto summarized that "there were no major problems" regarding the infection status of the people involved in the Games, but cited thorough behavioral management as an issue for the Paralympics. On the other hand, Secretary-General Muto Toshiro emphasized that "I think it was maintained as a whole" about the "bubble method" that blocks external contact with the players.
Hashimoto described it as "the most connected Olympics in history through digital communication," because viewing on the web and apps increased significantlyin while there were no spectators in the venues. She also evaluated that new sports such as skateboarding also stimulated the younger generation.
Tokyo Olympics plays last note, inspires world amid pandemic

As worldwide athletes and representatives in obvious joy gathered in the near-empty main stadium for one last time and the Olympic flame was extinguished, the Tokyo Olympic Games, arguably one of the most unusual in the Games' history, came to a conclusion after a spectacular show of the human spirit, sportsmanship, friendship and unity over the past two weeks or so at a time when the world is in desperate need of inspiration and hope.

While the empty seats at the closing ceremony offered a sobering reminder of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the smiling faces of the athletes and officials underscored the success of the Tokyo Games, where many sport stars were born, dreams came true and records were broken. 

Above all, the Tokyo Games offered hope and inspiration that the world can still come together to celebrate the human spirit despite all the challenges and hardship, as eyes are now turning to future major international events - the Winter Olympics 2022 in Beijing and Paris 2024 Olympics.

But before that there was plenty to cheer for Team China. The outstanding achievement by Chinese athletes at the Tokyo games has particularly thrilled the Chinese public, boosted their morale and patriotism as the Chinese delegation, with the largest-ever delegation of 777 people sent overseas, bagged a total of 88 medals and ranked 2nd in the medal table, lagging the US by just one gold medal.

Snatching 38 gold medals, Team China have achieved its best result in an overseas Olympics, tying with that at London 2012.     

Observers noted that a successfully held Olympics is a desperately needed inspiration to the world right now, for which the athletes and worldwide spectators have the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and the Japanese public to thank. 

After a series of performances featuring Japanese culture and characteristics at the closing ceremony, the Olympic flag was lowered down to the hands of Yuriko Koike, governor of Tokyo. Koike gave it to Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who then passed it on to Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Paris will host the Summer Olympics in 2024. 

Speaking at the closing ceremony, Bach said "For the first time since the pandemic began, the entire world came together." 

"Sport returned to center stage. Billions of people around the globe were united by emotion, sharing moments of joy and inspiration. This gives us hope. This gives us faith in the future."

Addressing the athletes who had assembled in the stadium, he said "You inspired us with this unifying power of sport. This is even more remarkable given the many challenges you had to face because of the pandemic."

Team China showcase dominance

In China, the Tokyo Olympics has kindled the general public's passion for sports, which is likely to enhance the sporting atmosphere of the whole society. To a depressed world amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Games brought the spirit of sportsmanship and a ray of light, highlighting global participation and cooperation, experts told the Global Times. 

The outstanding performance of the Chinese sports delegation has also sparked great passion and patriotic sentiment in China, and the Chinese public also showed much more mature and reasonable attitude to the Games and the athletes' performance rather than merely focusing on the number of gold medals.

In 16 days, 431 athletes from the Chinese mainland have won 38 gold medals, 32 silver medals and 18 bronze medals, lifting Team China to 2nd place in the medal table. 

On Sunday night, the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council sent congratulations to the delegation. 

"You have completed your mission to take part in the Olympic Games wonderfully," the congratulatory message read, hailing the athletes sport and moral excellence as well as their great sportsmanship.

Bouncing back from a disappointing Rio 2016, Team China in Tokyo have delivered a strong performance, tying with its best result in an overseas Olympics. 

China's traditional dominance in events like diving, weightlifting and table tennis remained strong, harvesting 12, 8 and 7 medals. In many non-dominant events, Team China also made breakthroughs, especially in track and field, where Chinese athletes collected five medals, including two golds. In sprinting, no medals were bagged but a new men's Asian record was set.

China's Generation Z athletes wowed the world with their outstanding performances. Fourteen-year-old Quan Hongchan drew worldwide praise in the 10m platform dive, 21-year-old shooter Yang Qian won China's first gold medal of the Games, and 21-year-old Li Wenwen led the way in the 87kg weightlifting class. Off the field, their stellar performances drew the love of netizens.

China's veterans illustrated the meaning of perseverance. Thirty-two-year-old Su Bingtian, who was also the flag bearer for the Chinese delegation at the closing ceremony, set an Asian record in the 100m sprint, 33-year-old Ma Long became the undisputed GOAT in table tennis history, 37-year-old weightlifter Lü Xiaojun has the respect of fitness people all over the world, and 32-year-old Gong Lijiao won China's first ever Olympic gold medal in field events.

"Due to the epidemic, China has been receiving controversial comments in the world in the past two years. In fact, every one of us athletes is holding our breath, not only to prove ourselves, but also to prove the strength of our country," a Chinese medalist who preferred to stay anonymous told the Global Times.

Nonetheless, beyond medal success, Team China have also done well in epidemic control and anti-doping. 

As of Sunday, the last match day of the Games, the delegation had no COVID-19 infections or no close contacts with infected cases. Chinese athletes were tested 226 times for doping as of August 6 and none tested positive, a spokesperson from the Chinese delegation said on Sunday, summing up its Tokyo journey. 

Team China fulfilled its goal to play clean and take clean medals at Tokyo, the spokesperson said. 

Experts noted that China's firm epidemic prevention work has powered the athletes' outstanding performance by guaranteeing them consistent training and determination. 

The anonymous Chinese medalist noted that Chinese athletes abided by stricter prevention standards in Tokyo than obeying those set by the Olympic Committee. 

"We wear masks everywhere, even with our own Chinese athletes, and we strictly disinfect ourselves whenever we went out or had our meals," the Chinese athlete said. 

Before leaving for Tokyo, the most common wish of the Chinese public for the athletes was not to get infected. Currently, there is one last step to reach this wish.

As of Sunday, 692 members of the Chinese delegation had returned to China, are in the middle of a 21-day quarantine, with isolation sites also available for training. 



Ignites passion for sports

Following the games around the clock, cheering on the Chinese athletes and discussing their off-field anecdotes - without realizing it, the Chinese public is beaming with pride and their passion for sports has once again been ignited. That is the kind of change a successful international event should bring, observers said.  

The Olympics was undoubtedly the hottest topic on the Chinese internet for the entire 16 days of the event. Among the top 50 trending topics on China's Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo, Olympic-related topics often occupied more than half the list. Such a high degree of heat reflects the passion of Chinese people for the Olympics.

"What we love about this Olympics is not just how dominant China's Dream Team are, but the fact that, unlike in the past, there are Chinese players competing almost every day," wrote one netizen on Sina Weibo, "The enthusiasm for the Olympics continued until the last day, and it was a great feeling to cheer for the athletes together with strangers."

Experts pointed out that although the audience could not be present, this year's Olympics received far more attention in China than the previous two Olympics. It also inspired patriotic feelings among Chinese people. 

"In the midst of the pessimism that gripped the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympics showed the audience the power of unity, and the Chinese audience also improved their understanding of sportsmanship," Zhang Yiwu, a professor of cultural studies at Peking University told the Global Times on Sunday.

The Chinese audience's attention to the Olympic Games goes beyond achievements and nationalities to focus more on the spark of humanity and the Olympic spirit itself.

During this year's Olympic Games, many international athletes were applauded by the Chinese public, including Latvian basketball player Edgars Krumins playing for gold with a broken ankle, Uzbekistan veteran Oksana Chusovitina making her eighth Olympic appearance, Italy's Gianmarco Tamberi and Qatar's Mutaz Barshim sharing the gold medal in the men's high jump, and 12-year-old Syrian Hend Zaza playing for her war-stricken country.

All these moving sporting moments have further germinated the spirit of sports in the hearts of the Chinese, and this is the greatest significance of the Olympic Games, analysts said.

Because the world saw the possibility of a successful event under the pandemic and the power that sport can bring to humanity, it also means expectations are higher for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympic Games, Zhang noted. 

Tokyo inspires the world



Unlike the opening ceremony, in the closing ceremony athletes did not enter in country order, but broke boundaries and entered the venue together, demonstrating unity. Moreover, the impact of the Games on athletes, spectators and the wider world will continue beyond the closing ceremony.

For the athletes, it is the best interpretation of the Olympic spirit to be able to overcome many difficulties to stand on the stage of the highest event again.

"The Tokyo Olympics offered me a new starting point and a platform to showcase my efforts in training and compete with other outstanding athletes to realize my dream," said the Chinese medalist, who beat his personal best in the Olympics, expressing his gratitude to Japan for holding such a grand event.

Much more importantly, the whole world is inspired. The success of the Tokyo Olympics has provided confidence and hope, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.

"The Tokyo Olympics showed us the possibility that people can return to normal life co-living with the virus," Da said. 

In the midst of an epidemic that has torn governments and public opinion in many countries, the Olympic motto, which just added "together," conveys a spirit of global participation and cooperation, Da said. 

About six months after the Tokyo Olympics, the Beijing Winter Olympics will take place.

"The success of the Tokyo Olympics this time around serves as a model for the Beijing Winter Olympics," Zhao Jisheng, a professor with the College of Physical Education and Sports at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times. 

However, some Western politicians are already encouraging various "diplomatic boycotts" of the Beijing Winter Olympics and putting pressure on sponsors, which is political extremism and a major enemy of the Olympics and a major threat to the unity of human society. But the Olympics will always play a positive role, preventing the spread of serious extremism, observers noted. 

"We have all reasons to believe in the success of Beijing Winter Olympics because of Beijing's performance in epidemic control, experience in hosting major events and the Chinese people's high spirit," Zhao said. EDITORIAL: A full accounting of the Tokyo Olympics must be the next step

The Tokyo Summer Olympic Games wind up on Aug. 8.

A huge sum of taxpayers’ money was spent to stage the event. In an unusual development, the Games, initially scheduled to be held in July and August 2020, were postponed for a year due to the novel coronavirus crisis.

But officials eventually decided to go ahead with the Games under a revised timetable, although public opinion was divided on the wisdom of holding them while the pandemic rages.

The central and Tokyo metropolitan governments, along with the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic organizing committee, have a duty to sort out the issues that have been raised, critically review the responses they took and present their findings to the Japanese public and the world.

The reviews, of course, should not be self-serving. The Diet should also keep a watchful eye in living up to its mission to monitor the executive branch of government.

After a failed bid to host the 2016 Summer Games, Tokyo in 2011 decided to make another bid for the 2020 Summer Games.

A number of questions and concerns have since been raised, such as suspected bribery related to the Olympic bid and a breakdown of the expenses for the Games that only kept swelling. But no convincing explanation has ever been given for many of them.

The Tokyo Games were initially billed as marking a rebuilding from the Great East Japan Earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. That concept, however, ended up being swept under the rug.

All these issues highlighted the same vicious practice that has characterized Japanese politics of recent years--sidestepping any inconvenient questions and accumulating facts after the fact, without ever making it clear where the responsibility lies.

For example, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proudly said that he took the initiative in deciding to delay the Games for a year. But his successor, Yoshihide Suga, has pretended to be an outsider by insisting that the Games are organized by the International Olympic Committee.

Who decided to postpone the Games for a year and then hold them while a pandemic is raging? On what authority were those decisions based, and what procedures were followed? All these issues must be answered for historical purposes.

The same can be said of measures to contain COVID-19 cases centered on tests and isolation, which officials promised to take.

Suspicion has been raised, for example, about the realities of COVID-19 tests on Olympic volunteer workers. The organizing committee has only said, “We are requesting workers to observe the rules,” and declined to disclose the daily numbers of those who worked and those who were tested.

The organizing committee has an obligation to present concrete data for sharing challenges and lessons with others, albeit somewhat belatedly, before the other nations of the world, which are wary of viruses that could be brought back from Japan.

Sharing the data would also be useful for other large-scale events that will be held in other countries in the months and years to come.

If the “legacy” of the Olympic Games for the future, the pet phrase of officials, is not about that, then what is it all about?

A mountain of other questions have yet to be reviewed critically or explained, such as how individuals involved in the planning of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies who resigned or were dismissed over scandals were appointed in the first place.

Officials should take to heart they will not be allowed to put the lid on problems in the shadow of the spectacular showing of the athletes.

Indispensable for that purpose is the preservation and disclosure of records and documents.

We have a bitter precedent over the Nagano Winter Games of 1998. A scandal was raised over suspected bribery in connection with the Olympic bid, but the truth was never established because the account books had been destroyed.

The central and metropolitan governments, as well as the organizing committee, must each have, as a matter of course, an archive of records that document details of their activities and decision-making processes.

The Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial four years ago that the organizing committee, which is technically not covered by laws or ordinances, should still exercise proper management of its archive of documents to fulfill its accountability before the public.

We are reiterating that argument here, as a fresh reminder.

--The Asahi Shimbun, Aug. 7Tokyo wraps up 2020 Olympics in subdued closing ceremony
The closing ceremony in Tokyo echoes the restraint of the Olympics held without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tokyo doused its Olympic flame on Sunday in a ceremony that echoed the restraint of the games held without spectators and transformed by the global pandemic, dazzling sport and deeply personal turmoil.

After postponing the Tokyo 2020 Games for a year, organisers said the event would serve as a symbol of world triumph over the pandemic. But with strict pandemic countermeasures and as COVID-19 variants have surged back around the world, the Olympics fell short of the triumph and financial windfall Japan had wanted.

The ceremony, although lustreless, gave athletes something of a glimpse of everyday Tokyo life as the Olympic Stadium was transformed into a park with grass, buskers and BMX riders.

The scene was meant so the visitors could “experience Tokyo”, organisers said, a poignant reminder of the many restrictions of the games.

It was a duly odd ending to an unprecedented event. Japan is now saddled with a $15bn bill, double what it initially expected, and with no tourist boom.

The president of the International Olympic Committee thanked the Japanese people and acknowledged the difficulty of staging the games during the pandemic.

“For the first time since the pandemic began, the entire world came together,” Thomas Bach said. “Nobody has ever organised a postponed games before.”

Public anger over the pandemic response and a slow-to-start vaccine rollout have badly damaged Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s standing. Public opinion polls showed most Japanese opposed holding the games during the pandemic.

Still, organisers appear to have prevented the Tokyo Games from spiralling into a COVID-19 super-spreader event, notable given that some 50,000 people came together amid the pandemic.

In a sign of the measures, winners accepted their prizes from trays, putting the medals around their own necks, although social-distancing protocols such as preventing hugging were largely ignored throughout the games.

While the bubble – the set of venues and hotels to which Olympic visitors were largely confined – appeared to hold, elsewhere some things fell apart. Fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus, daily infections spiked to more than 5,000 for the first time in Tokyo, threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.

Japan’s record medal haul also helped to take out some of the stings for organisers. The United States finished top of the tally with 39 gold medals, one more than rivals China at 38 and Japan at 27.

The games also showcased the Olympics’ push for more diversity.

For the first time, a victory ceremony was held for both the women’s and men’s marathon events. The Kenyan anthem filled the 68,000-capacity stadium twice, for gold medallists Peres Jepchirchir and Eliud Kipchoge. And when they came, the games themselves provided plenty of high drama.

In a moment more reminiscent of the Cold War, Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya refused to board a flight home after she was taken to the airport against her wishes. She has since sought refugee status in Poland.

US superstar gymnast Simone Biles shocked the world when she pulled out of five of her six events, including abruptly abandoning the women’s team final after attempting just one vault, citing concerns for her mental and physical health.

Her frank admission, combined with earlier comments by Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka, brought a sharp focus on issues of athletes’ mental health.

In athletics, Italy provided a different kind of shock with their amazing run. Their wins included a stunning gold in the men’s sprint relay, taking their athletics gold tally to five.

In swimming, a US team without 23-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Phelps still ended the meeting on top of the medals table.

Capping five years of intense preparations for athletes, some of them stretched out on the grass laid down in the stadium. Some appeared to relax as they watched a volley of fireworks light up the Tokyo sky.

For the first time ever, the closing ceremony featured live celebrations from the next host city as the people of Paris welcomed the handover of the Olympic flag.

In a pre-recorded video, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet performed the French national anthem on his saxophone – in zero gravity – from the International Space Station as a symbol of the Olympics’ universality, and jets released blue, white and red smoke – the colours of the French flag – over the skies of the capital.

French President Emmanuel Macron was filmed on the top floor of the Eiffel Tower reciting the newly updated Olympic slogan “higher, faster, stronger, together”.

The evening concluded at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo with a final flurry of fireworks and the word “Arigato” – Japanese word for thank you – lighting up the night sky.

A Memorable Olympics, but for the Right Reasons?
A feat of organizational planning and execution in a pandemic left even gold medalists hurrying home from an atmosphere drained of pomp and full of anxiety.

TOKYO — The kaleidoscopic stands of Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium — a disordered mosaic of white and green and reddish-brown seats — were designed to evoke the sun-dappled floor of a Japanese forest.

Over the past three weeks, though, they have had another, useful effect: Squint your eyes, blur them just so, and it almost appears as if spectators are arrayed around the sweeping structure, as if the 68,000-seat stadium is not essentially empty, as if these are a normal Olympic Games.

Of course, they were not. On Sunday night in Tokyo, a stripped-down closing ceremony in Japan’s sprawling national stadium will bring these extraordinary Games to an end, concluding an Olympics that, in some sense, felt like an illusion — at times convincing and fully welcome, at others jarringly off-key.

Pushing forth in a pandemic, these Games were meant to be, as the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said last year, “the light at the end of this dark tunnel the whole world is going through.” Yet they were often claustrophobic, cut off from society, with capacious venues across Tokyo repurposed into cloistered safe houses.

They were, in this way, paradoxical, uncanny and hard to wholly comprehend. They were a feat of organizational planning and execution, even amid arguments about whether they should be happening in the first place. They were stubbornly called Tokyo 2020, a retrograde name that reminded everyone of the meandering path traveled to this point. They were a made-for-television spectacle, stage-managed at times to the point of absurdity.

For athletes, these were an Olympics of survival, of resilience, of getting by and sometimes, in the end, being OK with falling short of a target. Yet even among medalists, there were feelings of ambivalence about being here, about enduring the alienating circumstances of one of the oddest Olympics in history.

“I can’t wait to get home,” the American sprinter Allyson Felix said after winning a bronze medal on Friday to become the most decorated female track athlete in Olympic history. “I’m counting the days, there are so few now.”

The coronavirus pandemic forced athletes to travel and perform here without the presence of friends or family, to say nothing of fans. They spent their time largely confined to their rooms, specially arranged buses and sports venues.

Though the lasting effects of the Olympics on Japan will be determined only in the weeks to come, early signs showed that the health protocols — the effort to cut off thousands of visitors from Tokyo residents — seemed to work, at least in the short term. At a news conference on Friday, Bach reported that 571,000 screening tests had been performed at the Olympics, returning a positivity rate of just 0.02 percent.

But the path to that point, the means of establishing what an I.O.C. spokesman called a “parallel world” inside the Games, has had an unmistakably estranging effect.

In the Olympic bubble, the competition sites — 38 in all — became eerie ghost ships. A surplus of volunteers manned stations that saw no foot traffic. Dance troupes performed in front of empty stands. Stadium announcers excitedly revved up nonexistent crowds. Events felt as if they could have been taking place almost anywhere — a sports hall in Stockholm, a convention center in Kansas City, a gymnasium in Dubai — so few were the distinguishing markers of place.

“If it had not been for the pandemic, this would go right up near the top of the best organized Olympics,” said the Olympic historian David Wallechinsky, who was attending his 19th Games.

The Olympics as a whole seemed like an oyster shell without a pearl.

The hollow feeling, on one hand, resulted from a relative deficit of once-in-a-generation standout performances in the most closely followed sports, and the handful of crowning achievements lacked the roar of a crowd.

Superstar athletes wilted under the city’s punishing sun, and established champions failed to live up to their own high standards.

Throughout, the motto “Citius, Altius, Fortius” — faster, higher, stronger — did not carry its old currency. Vulnerability, self-awareness and imperfection emerged as equally prominent themes.

Simone Biles, perhaps the most hyped Olympian before the Games, removed herself from early competition after developing the twisties — a gymnast’s version of the yips — before returning to claim a bronze medal. Naomi Osaka of Japan, who had lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony, exited in straight sets in the third round of the women’s tennis tournament. Novak Djokovic of Serbia, the top men’s player, lost his bronze medal match.

Even Caeleb Dressel, the swimmer who won five gold medals, lamented the strain of training an extra year — an unnatural cycle his coach had referred to as a “five-year quadrennial” — and the stress of making it through these Olympics.

“Some parts were extremely enjoyable,” Dressel said of his two weeks in Tokyo. “I would say the majority of them were not.”

Still, smaller, quieter moments glimmered through.

The camaraderie and celebrations of Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar, who decided, when offered, to share a gold medal in the high jump, charmed international viewers. So, too, did stories like that of Hidilyn Diaz, a weight lifter who claimed the first-ever gold medal for the Philippines, and Tamyra Mensah-Stock, whose sobbing interview after becoming the second U.S. woman to win gold in wrestling had a moment on social media.

Laurel Hubbard, a weight lifter from New Zealand, became the first transgender woman to compete at the Olympics, while nonbinary athletes whose identity does not fit neatly into longstanding gender categorizations also participated. One, the Canadian soccer player Quinn, won a gold medal.

Something resembling the Olympic spirit was, unexpectedly, often most easily observed in the newest sports, some of which were maligned as overly kooky when they were announced. At the sport climbing wall, competitors huddled to examine and discuss the configuration of holds on the walls, trading notes on how best to attack the challenges. At the skateboard park, rivals hugged and consoled Misugu Okamoto, 15, of Japan, who had cried after falling in the finals, lifting her onto their shoulders until she laughed.

Asked about the moment by reporters, she cried again.

“I’m grateful,” Okamoto said.

Not too far away, the Olympic Fan Park, a sprawling festival ground for ticket holders, sat dormant behind a padlocked fence, a sea of unused tables and attractions.

But Tokyoites found little keyhole glances of the Games, anyway. They glimpsed them on a train platform overlooking the BMX course, atop an overpass with a view of the sport climbing wall, from the side of the road as the cycling race whooshed by.

Modest crowds also gathered every night on a footbridge near Tokyo Bay, stopping and posing and taking pictures in front of the Olympic torch, even as security guards and volunteers halfheartedly asked them to keep moving. These were forgivable delinquencies, it seemed, for fans denied any other access to the Games. The mood was subdued but light.

“For some people who are paying attention, even enjoying watching it on television, it’s been gripping, I guess,” Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Japan, said of the Tokyo Olympics. “On the other hand, a large number of Japanese people are still terrified of the number of infections, which are going up, and the government’s inability to take action, at least in part because of the Olympics.”

Political controversies simmered — these were the Olympics, after all — but never quite detonated. Perhaps it was the I.O.C.’s deliberate pace on adjudicating any number of episodes — a Belorussian sprinter seeking political asylum; a podium demonstration from the American shot-putter Raven Saunders; two Chinese cyclists who wore pins depicting the silhouette of Mao Zedong — that kept each one from overtaking the narrative around the grounds.

Over the three weeks, questions about China, which will host the Winter Games early next year, when the pandemic is almost certain to still be raging, loomed large: To what extent would the I.O.C. and the athletes engage with issues of human rights in the country, like the mass detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities? Did the restrictions on personal freedoms in Tokyo, enforced in the name of public health, augur more stringent rules in Beijing? Bach refused to take any questions about China at his final news conference on Friday.

The thing that will stand out from these Games, then, will be their strangeness, the way the established Olympic norms became juxtaposed with cutting reminders of these extraordinary times.

Wallechinsky, the historian, attended his first Games in 1960, in Rome. On Friday night he was debating whether to attend the closing ceremony, as he normally does. It would be a shadow of a normal ceremony, with many athletes, in the interest of public safety, already home. What would be the point?

He said he would rather remember the national stadium the way he observed it during one of the track and field competitions last week, when a small group of competitors had gathered in the prismatically colored stands, close enough to cheer for their teammates and friends. The scene touched Wallechinsky, he said. He could let the harsh reality of these Games wash away, if only for a moment.

“It felt a little bit like the Olympics,” he said.

Olympic magic cut through the pandemic gloom, but the Tokyo Games’ legacy is complex

TOKYO — The flame that burned throughout one of history’s most controversial Games was extinguished Sunday as Japan brought the curtain down on the Tokyo Olympics with Closing Ceremonies that were as unusual as the event itself.

Most of the athletes weren’t present; they were sent home within 48 hours of competing as part of the strict rules meant to contain the coronavirus pandemic. For those who attended, organizers offered a show of music, juggling and dance that was supposed to replicate the experience of visiting a grassy Tokyo park — an experience that had been off-limits to athletes during the Games.

“In these difficult times, you gave the world the most precious of gifts: hope,” International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach told the athletes. “For the first time since the pandemic began, the entire world came together, sport returned to center stage, billions of people around the globe were united by emotion, sharing moments of joy and inspiration.”

It was a fitting, bittersweet end to a complicated Games. While the ban on spectators meant the Games looked and felt nothing like the electric showcase of Japan that organizers had hoped for, the Olympics nonetheless provided a much-needed respite, a burst of joy and human wonder, for viewers around the world exhausted by the pandemic.

Tokyo Games close with bittersweet sendoff for athletes, volunteers in pandemic Olympics

Day after day over two weeks, the magic of Olympic competition cut through the gloom and isolation of the pandemic. Hour after hour, athletes emerged after years of sacrifice, self-discipline and adversity to enter the global spotlight and light up the world’s hearts with their modesty, grace and joy.

“Life seems very divisive just now. Everybody’s in polarized positions, and there’s so much just controversy and frustration in life,” British Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy told the BBC. “It’s just wonderful to see the power of sport and the way it’s brought us all together and reminded us about the Olympic Games and the wonderful role that it plays in all our lives.”

Former U.S. Olympic sprint champion Michael Johnson agreed.

“This Games, even though it was a struggle getting it to start and getting it going, I think ultimately it was the relief that a lot of people needed,” he said.

New sports brought new audiences and new subcultures to the Games. The obvious camaraderie of the BMX riders, skateboarders and sports climbers shone brightly — and never more so than when 15-year-old Misugu Okamoto from Japan was carried off the skateboarding park on the shoulders of her fellow competitors after falling on her final run.

For Team USA, there were uncountable moments of enchantment, from 17-year-old Lydia Jacobs’s shocking victory in the 100-meter breaststroke to Allyson Felix’s bronze in the 400 meters at her fifth Olympics, and her first as a mother, as she became the most decorated female track and field athlete in Olympic history.

There was Sunisa Lee’s emergence from the shadow of Simone Biles to win the women’s all-around gymnastics title and the joy and relief for Biles when she won bronze on the balance beam after returning to competition.

There were Japan’s judo brother and sister Hifumi and Uta Abe, who won gold medals within an hour of each other, and Jason Kenny’s seventh gold in track cycling on the final day to become Britain’s most successful Olympian ever, beautifully capped by his fellow medalists lifting him on their shoulders on the podium.

For host country Japan, which suffered 18 months of anguish and anger over the pandemic-delayed event, there was a welcome burst of national pride as it recorded easily its greatest haul of 58 medals including 27 golds.

Japan proved to the world that, despite all of the criticism, it could hold an Olympic Games in the midst of a global pandemic. Some of the rules, including forcing athletes to wear masks on the podium and put medals around their own necks, might have seemed suffocating, but the thick web of restrictions proved effective in allowing the competition to go ahead.

Public opinion, so long skeptical or in some cases downright hostile, appeared to turn around, at least in part, with crowds turning out on the streets of Sapporo to cheer on the marathon runners in the Games’ final days.

Yet there was still an emptiness, a sense of loneliness and even a bitterness that the joy and achievement couldn’t wash entirely away.

The feeling that the IOC forced these Games on an unwilling public left an impression of arrogance and materialism, critics said, and the sexist and discriminatory attitudes of Japan’s conservative and elderly male elite in the run-up to the event was exposed to global scrutiny and caused national embarrassment.

There were signs of incremental progress: These were the most gender-balanced Games and the most diverse in terms of openly LGBTQ participation. The choice of Naomi Osaka to light the Olympic cauldron at the Opening Ceremonies was a well-received nod to Japan’s marginalized mixed-race population.

Japan boasted that it had used the Games to boost its citizens’ participation in sports and exercise, sailing into a global head wind of rising inactivity, and significantly improved disabled access to everything from venues to rail stations. On television, commentators talked more respectfully about mixed-race or transgender participants, even if intolerance and cruelty still raised its head on social media.

Yet there were also wounds, the biggest of which was partly self-inflicted.

Japan inexplicably dragged its feet over its coronavirus vaccination campaign, forcing it first to ban overseas fans and then even domestic spectators.

Olympians clustered in the empty stands to cheer their teammates, but this made-for-television Games was deprived of the communal passion, the fervor and the fun that come with a hyped-up crowd.

Athletes clutching medals gamely waved at their far-off families on video screens, but the absence of their families and friends was palpable.

Bach boasted that 1 out of 10 Japanese people had seen some part of the Games, but outside the fenced-off and policed competition venues, it sometimes felt as if Tokyo had turned its back on the Olympics.

It’s true there were some moments of enthusiasm: More than an hour before the Closing Ceremonies began, Tokyo residents lined up outside the stadium to get the best views of the fireworks. But there was no trace of the festival atmosphere that the Games usually bring to their host cities.

Instead of welcoming foreigners with open arms and showing Japan’s famous hospitality, the mood toward outsiders seemed at times to crystallize into silent mistrust of the tens of thousands of strangers who might be bringing in new strains of the coronavirus. Outward-facing Japan seemed to turn its face inward.

And all the while, in Tokyo and across Japan, the pandemic worsened, setting records with regularity. Daily cases rose by nearly four times during the two weeks of the Olympics.

The IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers boasted every day of their extensive testing setup and how few people involved in the Games had tested positive — 430 since the beginning of July.

On Sunday, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said there was no “medical or scientific” proof that cases had spread from the Olympic bubble to the general public.

But many public health experts were not persuaded. They argued the Games undermined the government’s already unconvincing calls for self-restraint and suggested the Olympic bubble was far more porous than organizers had claimed.

“I thought of the legacy of this Olympics,” said Kenji Shibuya, the former founding director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College London who recently moved back to Japan to help with mass vaccination efforts. “First, it clearly showed that unless the pandemic is tackled, a safe and secure Olympics is a fantasy.”

Shibuya said the Games have “left a scar on Japanese society,” causing division and distrust as well as a “health and economic debt.”

The IOC will walk away from these Games with its broadcast revenue intact and its finances in good shape. The Japanese taxpayers, though, will be left footing a multibillion-dollar bill — a huge hangover without having been invited to the party.

“The athletes should be the focus of the Games, and they have gone a long way in rescuing the extravaganza from the venal and feckless global sports aristocracy and Japan’s political elite,” said Jeff Kingston, a professor of political science at Temple University Japan.

But “the stories of resilience and indomitable spirits overcoming adversity” couldn’t mask the unpalatable truths the Games exposed, he said.

“The pandemic Olympics featured some glorious performances, but the empty venues made them an eerie rather than epic experience, a brief diversion from the surging delta curse.”
